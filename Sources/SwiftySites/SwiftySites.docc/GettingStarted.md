# Getting Started

With SwiftySites you define your website in a Swift Package. The package needs to contain an executable target which will depend on the SwiftySites library.

When you declare your site you provide:

- A configuration containing your site's metadate like title and copyright notice.
- All of the content instances grouped by type. Each type may specify arbitrary metadata as well as markdown content.
- The templates to be applied to content instances to generate output like HTML.

When your executable runs, it will call the site's render method which will produce all of the static site's files.

## Using Xcode

You can edit, build and run your website Swift package using Xcode.

### Working Directory

For convenience make sure you set the working directory to where your `Package.swift` resides. This way the location of the `www` folder will be the same as when running from the command line.

To set your working directory within Xcode go to `"MySite" Scheme > "Edit Schemeâ€¦" > Run (Sidebar) > Options (Tab) > Working Directory > "Use custom working directory:"` and specify your package's root.

### Production Build

By default Xcode generates the development version of your site. To switch to production change your scheme to use `Release` configuradion instead of the default Debug.

Command line builds also generate debug builds by default. To change this use the `-c` option and specify `release` as configuration.

```sh
swift run -c release
```

## Passing parameters

```sh
swift run -c release MySite --clean
```

Options passed directly to ``Site/render(clean:skipSitemap:skipStatic:)`` method override those specified on the command line.

To get all available options.

```sh
swift run MySite --help
```

To generate an auto-completion script.

```sh
swift run MySite --generate-completion-script zsh
```
